# js-xtract
JavaScript Feature Extraction Library

## About
This project provides a low-level feature extraction library for the JavaScript language. This provides several functions, based mostly from LibXtract, providing feature analysis for audio inside every browser. You can use the functions literally, within an object or even through the powerful Web Audio API.

## Use
Simply include the jsXtract.js file in your HTML or dynamically load for access to all the functions. The jsXtract-wa.js provides the web audio integration, this is not required for non-Web Audio powered pages.

## Development
This work is still in active development so please submit any issue reports for bugs and improvements. This is part of a set of projects for the DMT Lab at Birmingham City University.
